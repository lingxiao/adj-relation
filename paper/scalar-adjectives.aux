The first two columns show results for the two best models combined with pointwise estimation baseline using Beta-Binomial model. The third column displays Mohit's MILP method using N-gram data only. The results shows that $l_1$-logistic regression outperformed elastic net regression on most data sets by a small (possibly insignificant) margin, otherwise they are equivalent. In particular, oberve how logistic regression performs just as well on Mohit's set as it does no the Turk set. Furthermore, both model outperform MILP by a non-trivial amount on all gold sets. Finally, note how well the MILP method performs on Mohit's gold cluster, versus how poorly it performs on other gold standards.}}{39}}

The middle row is an example where Bansal' MILP correctly predicted the ranking despite sparse data, only six out of twenty pairs had any N-gram hits. Using Markov assumption the missing data was filled in, but at the cost accuracy. The bottom row shows an instance where both methods fail because there is overwhelming copora evidence that higher is more intense than soaring, revealing the limitations of the pattern-based approach.}}{46}}

Finally we see Mohit's set performed best on the PPDB data set, but it appears as if there is a slight negative relationship between PageRank values and adjective strength on the N-gram set. }}{55}}
