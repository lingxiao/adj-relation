Adjectives such as good, great, and excellent are similar in meaning but differ in intensity. Intensity ordering is useful in several NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and question answering. However this data is missing in most lexical resources such as dictionaries and WordNet. In this thesis we first review and replicate the state of the art in adjective ranking by \newcite{demelo:13} using monolingual copora. Then we extend their approach in along two fronts: first by augmenting monolingual data with data derived from bilingual copora for greater coverage, then we propose a variety of new approaches to the problem. Additionally we procure a new gold standard using mechanical turks and evaluate all methods on both gold standards. Notably, our best method achieves $75\%$ pairwise accuracy and $0.61$ Kendall's-$\tau$ on both gold standards, exceeding Bansal's method by a nontrivial amount, and approaches inter-annotator accuracy.
